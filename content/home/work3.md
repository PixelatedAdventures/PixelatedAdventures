Pixel art game with a very characteristic style, both for its bizarre characters and its careful design in black and white.

## [Play on itch.io!](https://ludipe.itch.io/missing-translation)

Set in a weird village in the middle of the desert, we can choose between 2 characters (male and female) to solve over 100 puzzles that will catch us in the game for hours. The various puzzles that are featured in Missing Translation will make us use our wits if we are to discover the end of this curious adventure.

One of the greatest virtues of Missing Translation is that it includes an original language that we have to decipher in order to find the way home. These incredible challenges will hook us on to our devices for long time before we can decipher all the enigmas

Missing Translation has also been awarded many times, chosen Best Game of the Japan Weekend, Best Original Idea in hoPLAY and 3rd place in the Big Indie Pitch. To top it off Missing Translation has 4 nominations in the 2015 Gamelab Awards including Best Game of the Year!
